## NIR Spectroscopy Dataset for Non-Invasive Glucose Estimation

This repository provides datasets supporting research on non-invasive blood glucose estimation using palm-based near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). It includes spectra collected from glucose solutions, blood samples, and palm tissue under controlled conditions.

### 📁 Dataset Contents
- `data/aqueous-glucose-sample-data.csv` — Glucose solution spectra
- `data/anonymised-blood-sample-data.csv` — Blood spectra with reference glucose
- `data/anonymised-train-data-processed-palm-compiled.csv` — Palm spectra for model training
- `data/anonymised-calibration-data-processed-palm-compiled.csv` — Palm spectra for calibration
