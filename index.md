*__Palm NIRS for Nonâ€‘Invasive Glucose Estimation__*

**Abstract**
This dataset supports the development of non-invasive blood glucose estimation models using palm-based near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). It includes spectra collected from glucose solutions, human blood samples, and palm tissue under controlled experimental conditions, enabling analysis of how optical scattering and tissue heterogeneity influence glucose signal quality and model performance.

**Ethics Statement**
This experimentation to spectroscopically study the blood glucose properties in NIR spectral range, involving human subjects, was reviewed and approved by the
Institutional Ethics Committee at Amrita Institute of Medical Sciences and Research under approval No: ECASM-AIMS-2024-336. Written informed consent was obtained
from all patients before enrollment.
